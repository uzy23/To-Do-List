# To-Do-List
This responsive To-Do List app lets users add, edit, complete, and delete tasks. Completed tasks get struck through, turn grey, and auto-delete after 2 seconds. The app prevents empty inputs and displays the current date in a readable format using JavaScript. It adjusts well to different screen sizes using relative units and media queries.
